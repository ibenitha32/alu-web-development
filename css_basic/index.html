				<h1>Welcome to MY World!</h1>
				<h2>There's nothing in it</h2>
				<h3>Oh, Wait!...</h3>

				<p>Here is something for your viewing pleasure! Smh. Please do not hate me.<br>
				
				A cat sat on the mat. The mat was made of felt. The cat was made of fur. The felt was made of wool. The wool was made of sheep. The sheep were made of grass. The grass was made of dirt. The dirt was made of rock. The rock was made of earth. The earth was made of the universe. The universe was made of nothing.</p>

				<p>Nothing is something. Something is nothing. The cat is the mat. The mat is the cat. The felt is the fur. The fur is felt. The wool is the sheep. The sheep is the wool. The grass is the dirt. The dirt is the grass. The rock is the earth. The earth is the rock. The universe is the earth. The earth is the universe.</p>

				<p>The cat is not the mat. The mat is not the cat. The felt is not the fur. The fur is not felt. The wool is not the sheep. The sheep is not the wool. The grass is not the dirt. The dirt is not the grass. The rock is not the earth. The earth is not the rock. The universe is not the earth. The Earth is not the universe.</p>

				<p>Do not worry. IDK what this is, either. Understanding is not a friend. Mad, we go. There's no other choice. Yes, I'm trying to write the fourth paragraph, with nothing in particular, exactly like the ones above, but this is special, this is unique, just like you. Bet I made you smile with that, No? Okay, I'll leave you but it was to either be this or the Lorem Ipsum stuff... This is less maddening. You're welcome!</p>
